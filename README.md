# Anti-RickRoll

A neat little plugin that was forked from: [This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rick-roll-detector/naiegljfmojjaphollbjobpedcdnkkfp?hl=en)

RickGuard (a play of of UGuard) is a simple little program that warns you of any (known) rick-roll links by putting a rick astly *guarding* (see what i did there?) the link, if you are blind enough to still click the link, it warns you with an alert!. Now, you may be thinking *What if it's a bit.ly link?* no worries! it will auto-stop the rick-roll and tell you. One feature of RickGuard is if you just want to listen to the song, you can! just click on the link, press ok, then on the next alert press cancel and play the song!

I have spent so long tweaking and googling and i am proud of what i have created. So please give some support.
