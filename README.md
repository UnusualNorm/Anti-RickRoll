# Anti-RickRoll

A neat little plugin that was forked from: [This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rick-roll-detector/naiegljfmojjaphollbjobpedcdnkkfp?hl=en)

RickGuard is a simple little program that warns you of any (known) rick-roll links. Now, you may be thinking *What if it's a bit.ly link?* no worries! it will auto-stop the rick-roll and tell you.

I have spent so long tweaking and googling and i am proud of what i have created. So please give some support.
